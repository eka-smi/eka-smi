## Hi there 👋

# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ekaterina Smirnova**, a physics + ML researcher based in **Moscow, Russia**.  
I work at the intersection of **scientific computing** and **machine learning**, with a focus on building **reproducible experiments** and turning complex models into clear, testable results. 

Right now this profile is where I publish smaller research projects, notebooks, and experiments — clean baselines, ablations, and well-documented conclusions.
